JHU Data Science Specialization
===============================

Project and miscellany for the [Coursera track on data science](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1/overview). The track consists of nine independent 4-week courses and this repo will be updated with projects as I complete them.

Please note that for the sake of portability, I do not store the original data sets along with the source code. The data sources will be linked within each project's README file.

The code contained within this repository is my own independent work unless stated otherwise. I am making it publicly available, but please do not copy it if doing so would violate any code of integrity you have agreed to abide by.
